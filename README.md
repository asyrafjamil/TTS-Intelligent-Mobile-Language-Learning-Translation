# TTS-Intelligent-Mobile-Language-Learning-Translation (InMoLTs)

I am happy to announce the release of InMoLTs. This release intends to share a mobile application that can teach basic German language.

## InMoLTs Mobile App

TTS Intelligent Mobile Learning Language Translation (InMoLTS) is a mobile application that is for educational purposes. Foreign languages are very vital in this era. Unfortunately, people often do not have the opportunity to learn a foreign language due to the cost of investing in classes and time constraint. In addition, Google Translate is not a suitable platform to learn foreign language. InMoLTs teaches the users on how to know and understand basic German language. It translates English sentences to German sentences. It includes audio files for every sentence and concatenative synthesis is implemented to reduce the noise and make the audio files better and precise. The first step is by doing segmentation for every audio file. Noise and unnecessary data are removed from this step. Secondly, the audio files’ features are extracted by using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC). The tools that are used are Android Studio, Pycharm (Python IDE) and Wavesurfer. Android studio is to develop the mobile application’s interface and functionality. Pycharm is to implement MFCC. Wavesurfer is to segment the audio files. The main motive of the mobile application is to translate English sentences to German sentences. Apart from that, users able to do exercises based on their preference on the difficulty levels. The notes fragment consists of many categories such as “Greetings”, “Giving and Asking for Directions”, “Visiting a German Restaurant”, “Dealing with Medical Emergencies” and “Numbers”. Java language is used to implement the mobile application. Based on the findings, 95% of the end users are satisfied with the prototype. In addition, 90% of the end users said that the prototype can help them in achieving their goal of learning German language. Furthermore, 40% of the end users gave a rating of the prototype 8 out 10, while 10% gave a rating 9 out of 10, 30% gave a rating 8 out of 10, 15% gave a rating 7 out of 10 and the rest gave 5 out of 10. Bottom line, all functions of the mobile application run smoothly and successfully tested hence the success of the development.
